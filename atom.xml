        <content type="html" xml:base="https://cyoung2024.github.io/grapheneos/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve had an iPhone since I was 12 years old. I grew up loving it. Its interface felt clean and each new phone Apple released seemed even better than the last. Over time, however, this changed. Now owning an iPhone 14, I&#x27;ve found several greviances. Not all of them are specific to the iPhone, and some of them could likely be avoided if I were more careful with tuning the settings of the phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI features piss me off. I don&#x27;t want them. Copilot in VSCode can stay, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&#x27;t sideload apps easily.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The core features only work well with other Apple products. I don&#x27;t own any other Apple products, nor do I want to. My truck doesn&#x27;t even have CarPlay.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My phone is packed with obnoxious bloat and notifications pulling my attention.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every app now wants all my data. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re really doing with it or what&#x27;s going on in the background.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#x27;m starting to notice more and more software bugs. The experience doesn&#x27;t feel premium anymore.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s time for something new.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-grapheneos&quot;&gt;Enter GrapheneOS&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t remember what introduced me to alternative mobile operating systems, but I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;GrapheneOS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a couple weeks before PewDiePie mentioned it in his &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u_Lxkt50xOg&quot;&gt;Degoogling video&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It looked ideal, so I ordered myself a Google Pixel 9.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation-and-setup&quot;&gt;Installation and setup&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dumb ass did not read throught the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;faq#supported-devices&quot;&gt;docs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, so I ended up purchasing a Pixel from Verizon that was OEM locked. Thankfully Verizon took the phone back for a small fee. After buying a Pixel straight from Google, unlocking the bootloader and flashing the OS was braindead easy. The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;install&#x2F;web&quot;&gt;web installer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; worked flawlessly and the operating system is void of any mandatory setup process. Although I would like to eventually disconnect myself from Google, I used the Play Store to install most of my apps. I intend to experiment with a slow migration later, when I have the home server infrastructure set up to support it. Over time, I&#x27;ll build this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CYoung2024&#x2F;apks&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with my favorite replacements.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;verizon-is-trash&quot;&gt;Verizon is trash&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my new phone is all set up ready to go - except Verizon won&#x27;t seem to let me switch the eSim from my iPhone to the Pixel. After removing it from the iPhone, I can&#x27;t even add it back. So now I have two paper weights sitting on my desk until a SIM card arrives in the mail on Thursday. Thanks Verizon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://cyoung2024.github.io/firstpost/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not much of a writer, but I&#x27;d like to get better. Plus, I need a place to document all the cool stuff I like to do. Maybe it won&#x27;t be that cool to others, but it&#x27;ll be neat to look back on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-this-site-built&quot;&gt;How is this site built?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to take what I write in Markdown and render it as a static site. I&#x27;m too lazy to work with CSS, and it has some nice &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;st1020&#x2F;kita&quot;&gt;themes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The workflow is straightforward, which is what I&#x27;m looking for. I want the process of creating and uploading new entries to be super simple and low-effort, so it won&#x27;t discourage me from writing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on having much more than a blog here, so it should work. I&#x27;ll throw anything else I want on a subdomain I guess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;that-s-all&quot;&gt;That&#x27;s all&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll probably share this site with a few folks to keep myself motivated to use it. Might be a good place to post what I&#x27;m learning about in the Word as well. We&#x27;ll see!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
