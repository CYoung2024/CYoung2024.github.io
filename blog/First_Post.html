        <p>***Imported from old site</p>
        <p>I'm not much of a writer, but I'd like to get better. Plus, I need a place to document all the cool stuff I like to do. Maybe it won't be that cool to others, but it'll be neat to look back on.</p>
        <h2>How is this site built?</h2>
        <p>I'm using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> to take what I write in Markdown and render it as a static site. I'm too lazy to work with CSS, and it has some nice <a href="https://github.com/st1020/kita">themes</a>. The workflow is straightforward, which is what I'm looking for. I want the process of creating and uploading new entries to be super simple and low-effort, so it won't discourage me from writing.</p>
        <p>I don't plan on having much more than a blog here, so it should work. I'll throw anything else I want on a subdomain I guess.</p>
        <h2>That's all</h2>
        <p>I'll probably share this site with a few folks to keep myself motivated to use it. Might be a good place to post what I'm learning about in the Word as well. We'll see!</p>
